// Here's the task: I want you to write a function in Javascript that takes a URL as a string, and extracts the domain name from it. Your function should only return the domain name as a string, without any subdomains, paths, or protocols.


// * url = "http://github.com/carbonfive/raygun" -> domain name = "github"
// * url = "http://www.zombie-bites.com"         -> domain name = "zombie-bites"
// * url = "https://www.cnet.com"                -> domain name = cnet"
